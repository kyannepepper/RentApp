# Human Interface Guidelines

## Feedback

Feedback helps people know whatâ€™s happening, discover what they can do next, understand the results of actions, and avoid mistakes.

In my app I intentionally focused on making sure there was good feedback everytime they went to submit something. It would have an error or a success sign. I also included haptics and sound for when the user hits the pay button to insure that the user knows their payment went through successfully.

## Navigation - Tab bars

A tab bar lets people navigate between top-level sections of your app like the Alarm, Stopwatch, and Timer tabs in the Clock app.

In my app I included a tab bar navigation at the bottom of my app to help the user know which page they are on. It also helps them to easily navigate the app and move to a different page.


# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
